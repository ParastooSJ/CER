# CER

## CER is a Contextual Entity Retrieval method that models contextual relationship between entities and effectively limits the extensive search space without compromising performance. In this method, a model is trained to prune an extracted subgraph from a textual knowledge graph that represents the relations between entities and then a second deep model is trained to rank entities in the subgraph by reasoning over the textual content of nodes, edges, and the given question.
